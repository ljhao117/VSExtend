# VSExtend README

I find out that coders are hate writing comment in code. Some of them may think it hrad to write and wasting lot of time. So I want to develop a VS extend that can make a comment quickly and there is a lot of comment extends I can choose but still want to make one by myself.

## Features

I still learning how to develop a extend, so can't make sure my unfinish extend could have any feature ;) 

## Requirements

A computer installed VSCode I guess?

### 0.0.1

Hello World in console log and window message information

## Working with Markdown

**Note:** You can author your README using Visual Studio Code.  Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

* Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
* Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
* Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets

### For more information

* [Markdown Syntax Reference](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

**Enjoy!**
